# Animations & UX Improvements

## Fixed Issues âœ…

### 1. Turn Indicator Positioning
**Problem:** The "Player X's Turn" label was covering the chat/battle log on the right side.

**Solution:** Moved the turn indicator from `bottom-20 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2` (centered bottom) to `bottom-20 left-4` (bottom left corner).

**Location:** `web/app/page.tsx` - Turn indicator now appears in bottom-left corner with proper z-indexing.

## New Animations & Interactive Elements

### 1. **Unit Movement & Hover Effects**
**Location:** `web/app/components/Billboard3DDemo.tsx`

- **Smooth Position Transitions:** Units now animate smoothly when moving across the map
  ```css
  transition: "left 0.5s ease-out, top 0.5s ease-out, transform 0.2s"
  ```
- **Hover Scaling:** Units scale up 110% on hover with a glowing white border
- **Selection Indicator:** Selected units show a pulsing double-ring indicator

### 2. **Health Bar Enhancements**
**Location:** `web/app/components/Billboard3DDemo.tsx`

- **Smooth Color Gradient:** Health bars now use a three-color gradient (red â†’ yellow â†’ green)
- **Animated Transitions:** Health changes animate over 500ms
- **Low Health Effects:** Units below 30% HP show:
  - Reduced opacity (0.6)
  - Pulsing animation on the unit card
  - Bright saturated health bar colors

### 3. **Phase Indicator**
**Location:** `web/app/page.tsx`

- **Slide-in Animation:** Appears with `animate-in slide-in-from-top-4`
- **Round Counter:** Shows current round with styled badge

### 4. **Turn Indicator Improvements**
**Location:** `web/app/page.tsx`

- **Repositioned:** Now in bottom-left corner (no longer blocks chat)
- **Slide-in Animation:** `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-4`
- **Pulsing Player Dot:** Blue (P1) or Red (P2) with pulse animation
- **Ready Status:** Shows "âœ“ Other player ready" in emerald when opponent submitted
- **Shadow Effects:** Better depth with `shadow-lg`

### 5. **Status Bar Redesign**
**Location:** `web/app/page.tsx`

- **Compact Grid Layout:** Moved to top-left corner
- **Smaller Footprint:** Grid-based layout instead of horizontal flex
- **Color-coded Stats:**
  - ðŸ”µ Blue for Player 1 score
  - ðŸ”´ Red for Player 2 score

  drop-shadow-[0_0_8px_rgba(251,146,60,0.8)]
  ```
- **Coffee Curious:** â˜• Pulsing coffee cup icon
- **Animated Quirk Badges:** Visual indicators above units

### 7. **Selection & Hover Tooltips**
**Location:** `web/app/components/Billboard3DDemo.tsx`

## Animation Types Used

### CSS Transitions
- `transition-all duration-300` - General UI elements
- `transition-all duration-500` - Health bars
- `left/top 0.5s ease-out` - Unit movement

### Tailwind Animations
- `animate-pulse` - Phase dots, turn indicator dots, low health units
- `animate-bounce` - Fire quirk icons
- `animate-ping` - Low health damage flash effect
- `animate-spin` - Loading spinner
- `animate-in fade-in` - Status bar entrance
- `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-4` - Turn indicator entrance
- `animate-in slide-in-from-top-4` - Phase indicator entrance
- `animate-in slide-in-from-bottom-2` - Battle log messages

### Transform Effects
- `hover:scale-110` - Unit hover scaling
- `hover:z-10` - Brings hovered units to front
- `transform` - Various positioning and rotation effects

---

## Visual Hierarchy Improvements

### Z-Index Layers
1. `z-10` - Hovered units (temporary elevation)
2. `z-30` - Battle log (OutcomeStream)
3. `z-40` - Phase indicator, game over button, processing overlay
4. `z-50` - Turn indicator, status bar, GroupSheet, tooltips

### Color Coding
- **Player 1:** Blue tones (`#3b82f6`, `blue-500`)
- **Player 2:** Red tones (`#ef4444`, `red-500`)
- **Health:** Red â†’ Yellow â†’ Green gradient
- **Morale:** Purple â†’ Pink gradient
- **Status:** Emerald for success, Orange for warnings

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Hardware Acceleration:** Transform and opacity animations use GPU
2. **Transition Timing:** Balanced at 300-500ms for responsiveness
3. **Conditional Rendering:** Low health effects only shown when needed
4. **Optimized Re-renders:** Animations use CSS instead of JS when possible

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- [ ] Particle effects for attacks (explosions, sparks)
- [ ] Trail effects for unit movement
- [ ] Screen shake on major combat events
- [ ] Floating damage numbers
- [ ] Victory/defeat celebration animations
- [ ] Sound effects (optional toggle)
- [ ] Unit class-specific animations
- [ ] Weather/terrain effects
