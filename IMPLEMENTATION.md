# 🎮 Dominiocracy - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### Core Game Systems

#### 1. **Complete Game Loop** ✅
- **Draft Phase**: Players select 6 units from pools of 10 random units
- **Orders Phase**: Simultaneous hot-seat order submission
- **Interpretation Phase**: Gemini AI converts orders → unit intents
- **Resolution Phase**: 10-tick battle simulation
- **Scoring Phase**: Calculate winner based on units/health/territory

#### 2. **Unit System** ✅
- 6 unit classes: Warrior, Mage, Ranger, Cleric, Rogue, Bard
- 10 unique quirks affecting interpretation
- Procedural stat generation (attack, defense, speed, discipline, morale)
- Health system with max HP tracking

#### 3. **AI Integration** ✅
- Gemini 2.0 Flash API endpoint (`/api/interpret`)
- Sophisticated prompt engineering for comedic misinterpretation
- Per-unit intent generation based on quirks
- Chaos level affecting interpretation quality

#### 4. **Battle Simulation** ✅
- 10-tick resolution system
- Movement toward targets
- Attack mechanics with damage calculation
- Health tracking and death detection
- Real-time visual updates

#### 5. **Scoring System** ✅
- Points for units alive (20 each)
- Points for remaining health
- Points for territory control
- Win conditions: elimination or 5 rounds

#### 6. **UI Components** ✅
- `DraftPhase`: Beautiful unit selection interface
- `CommandComposer`: Order input with urgency/resource controls
- `Billboard3DDemo`: 2D battlefield visualization with health bars
- `OutcomeStream`: Live feed of battle events
- `GroupSheet`: Unit details panel
- Game status bar with phase/round/scores

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start**: Click "Start New Game"
2. **Draft**: Player 1 selects 6 units, then Player 2
3. **Orders**: 
   - Player 1 types an order (e.g., "defend the center")
   - Player 2 types an order
4. **Watch**: 
   - Gemini interprets each unit's understanding
   - 10-tick battle plays out with live updates
5. **Score**: Round results shown
6. **Repeat**: Up to 5 rounds or until elimination

## 🧠 Unit Quirks & Interpretation

Each unit has 2 random quirks that affect how they interpret orders:

| Quirk | Example Misinterpretation |
|-------|---------------------------|
| coffee-curious | "Defend the hill" → "Build a coffee shop on the hill for morale" |
| fire-enthusiast | "Be sneaky" → "Set everything on fire so no one can see us" |
| overly-literal | "Take the high ground" → "Carry the hill to a higher location" |
| rebel | "Advance" → "Retreat while playing loud music" |
| paranoid | "Scout ahead" → "Hide in a bush and suspect everyone" |
| kiss-ass | "Hold position" → "Build a monument to your leadership here" |

## 🎨 Visual Features

- **Color-coded units**: Blue border = Player 1, Red = Player 2
- **Health bars**: Real-time HP during battles
- **Status effects**: Fire/coffee icons for quirks
- **Outcome stream**: Live feed of interpretations and battle events
- **Phase indicators**: Always know what's happening

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Game Balance
- Units: 6 per player
- Rounds: Max 5 or until elimination
- Chaos: Starts at 50, increases +10 per round
- Health: 80-120 per unit
- Battle: 10 ticks at 500ms each

## 📊 Scoring Breakdown

**Per Round:**
- Units Alive: 20 points each
- Total Health: HP/2
- Territory: 0-50 points based on position

**Win Conditions:**
1. Enemy elimination (instant win)
2. Highest score after 5 rounds
3. Draw if tied

## 🚀 Performance

- **Build**: ✅ Successful production build
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized with Next.js 16
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage
- **API**: Server-side Gemini calls (secure)

## 🎮 Controls

- **Click map**: View battlefield
- **Click unit**: View details
- **Type order**: Give command
- **Issue Order**: Submit (both players must submit)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Suggested next steps:
1. **Network Multiplayer**: Real-time with WebSockets
2. **3D Visualization**: Three.js integration
3. **Replay System**: Watch past battles
4. **More Content**: 
   - Additional unit classes
   - Special abilities
   - Environmental hazards
   - Campaign mode
5. **Polish**:
   - Sound effects
   - Better animations
   - Mobile support

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Hot-seat only (no network play yet)
- 2D visualization (3D planned)
- No save/load system
- Limited to 2 players
- Gemini API rate limits may affect rapid testing
