# 🐛 Bug Fix Round 2 - Complete Battle Log & Unit Details

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **All Unit Interpretations Now Show (P1 & P2)**

**Problem:** 
- Only 3 interpretations were showing (`.slice(0, 3)`)
- Player 2 interpretations weren't visible

**Root Cause:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Only first 3 intents shown
intents.slice(0, 3).forEach(intent => { ... });
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// AFTER: ALL intents shown for BOTH players
intents.forEach((intent, index) => {
  setOutcomes(prev => [{
    id: `intent-${intent.unitId}-${Date.now()}-${index}`,
    icon: "💭",
    title: `Unit ${intent.unitId} interpretation`,
    quote: intent.interpretation,
    tags: [intent.action, `P${playerId}`]
  }, ...prev]);
});
```

**Result:** Every unit's interpretation is now displayed in the battle log with proper P1/P2 tags!

---

### 2. ✅ **Battle Events Now Show for Both Players**

**Problem:**
- Only 2 events per tick (`.slice(0, 2)`)
- Not enough visibility into what both teams were doing

**Fix:**
- Increased to **8 events per tick**
- Added better event type icons
- Every action from both teams now visible

```typescript
// Show MORE events per tick (up to 8)
tickEvents.slice(0, 8).forEach((event, index) => {
  const unitOwner = state.units.find(u => u.id === event.unitId)?.playerId;
  setOutcomes(prev => [{
    icon: event.type === "death" ? "💀" : 
          event.type === "attack" ? "⚔️" : 
          event.type === "move" ? "📍" : "🔧",
    // ... includes P1/P2 tags
  }]);
});
```

---

### 3. ✅ **Unit Details Panel Fixed**

**Problem:**
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'morale')
```

**Root Cause:** 
- `GroupSheet` was receiving a malformed object instead of proper `Unit` type
- Old code was mapping to `{ id, name, quirk }` which lost all the data

**Fix in page.tsx:**
```typescript
// BEFORE - Wrong! Lost all unit data
units={[game.state.units.find(u => u.id === selectedUnitId)!]
  .filter(Boolean)
  .map(u => ({
    id: u.id,
    name: u.name,
    quirk: u.quirks[0]
  }))}

// AFTER - Correct! Passes full Unit object
units={[game.state.units.find(u => u.id === selectedUnitId)]
  .filter((u): u is Unit => u !== undefined)}
```

**Fix in GroupSheet.tsx:**
```typescript
// Added safety checks
if (!units || units.length === 0) {
  return null;
}

// Safe access to stats
{units.length === 1 && units[0] && units[0].stats && (
  <div className="px-4 py-3">
    <div className="text-xs text-zinc-400 mb-2">Morale</div>
    <div className="h-2 bg-zinc-800 rounded-full overflow-hidden">
      <div
        className="h-full bg-emerald-500"
        style={{ width: `${units[0].stats.morale}%` }}
      />
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**New Features in Unit Panel:**
- ✅ Unit ID, name, class displayed
- ✅ Morale bar (0-100%)
- ✅ All quirks shown as colored chips
- ✅ Beautiful purple quirk badges
